		"authentication required for the gRPC TLS connection.\n" +
		"->Authentication of Clients: The server, acting as the hot wallet binary, should authenticate and validate the sovereign nodes (clients) " +
		"attempting to connect. Only trusted clients with the matching certificate will be granted access to interact with the hot wallet binary.\n" +
		"->Ensuring Secure Transactions: Utilize the certificate-based authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized sovereign nodes can access the hot wallet binary. " +
		"This step is crucial in maintaining the integrity and security of transactions being sent from the sovereign shards to the main chain.\n" +
		"->Ongoing Security Measures: Regularly review and update the certificate mechanism to maintain security. This includes renewal of certificates, " +
		"implementing security best practices, and promptly revoking access for compromised or unauthorized clients."
